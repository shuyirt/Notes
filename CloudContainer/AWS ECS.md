# Amazon ECS

## What is amazon ECS

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your services or tasks using the Fargate launch type. For more control you can host your tasks on a cluster of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage by using the EC2 launch type. 

## Cluster

An Amazon ECS cluster is a logical grouping of tasks or services. When you first use Amazon ECS, a default cluster is created for you, but you can create multiple clusters in an account to keep your resources separate.
